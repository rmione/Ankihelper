# anki helper

This is a simple script that helps me make Anki decks while studying different languages.

When transcribing the meaning of a word or a kanji, etc from a textbook I found it clumsy to use the Anki app due to its interface. 
Using this I just have to make an excel/google sheets file, save it as a .csv and then run the script which is a *lot* more convenient.
